# Typography & colours

## Overview

- *Continue work on your `ecommerce-pattern-library`*
- Targeting only HTML tags within your `theme.css`, style the basic typography for your website.
- Consider & style all the possible HTML tags related to typography.
- *Run your pattern library through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

---

## Details

Make sure to style (or at least consider) the following tags:

- *Headings:* `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`
- *Lists:* `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>`
- *Links:* `<a>`
- *Blockquotes:* `<blockquote>`, `<cite>`
- *Emphasis & edits:*, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<del>`, `<ins>`, `<abbr>`, `<dfn>`, `<i>`, `<b>`, `<mark>`, `<q>`, `<s>`, `<u>`

**You don’t have to regenerate your Pattern Library after every change.** If you’re just changing your `theme.css` a refresh is good enough. That’s still slow though, so you can open up each HTML file in the `typography` pattern, like `01-headings.html` directly in the browser and refresh there.

**Don’t change any of the code in the `typography` folder—only write CSS in your `theme.css` file this week.**
