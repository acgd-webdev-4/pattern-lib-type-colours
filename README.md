# Typography & colours

## Overview

- *Continue work on your `ecommerce-pattern-library`*
- Targeting only HTML tags within your `theme.css`, style the basic typography for your website.
- Consider & style all the possible HTML tags related to typography.
- **Think about the default typography for generic HTML elements:**
  - What’s the default stying for an `<h1>` (not all `<h1>` tags need look the same, but what’s the primary)
  - What’s the default stying the links?
  - What’s the default stying for lists?
  - *etc.*
- *Run your pattern library through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

## Details

Make sure to style (or at least consider) the following tags:

- *Headings:* `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`
- *Lists:* `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>`
- *Links:* `<a>`
- *Blockquotes:* `<blockquote>`, `<cite>`
- *Emphasis & edits:*, `<em>`, `<strong>`, `<del>`, `<ins>`, `<abbr>`, `<dfn>`, `<i>`, `<b>`, `<mark>`, `<q>`, `<s>`, `<u>`

Focus on `color`, `font-weight`, `font-style` & `font-family`. We don’t need to specify `margin`, `padding` or `font-size` because those already exist within the Typografier classes.

**You don’t have to regenerate your Pattern Library after every change—it will automatically regenerate & refresh for you.** That’s still slow though, so you can open up each section in the pattern library into a new browser tab and refresh there. *Look for this little pop-out arrow at the top of a section.*

**Don’t change any of the code in the `typography` folder—only write CSS in your `theme.css` file this week.**
